# Multiset 

# The Multiset was built using AVL and Splay Trees
Supports folowing operations:

1. Insert a number x to multiset S;
2. Erase a number equal to x from S if exists;
3. Find the order of x in S;
4. Find the x-th smallest number in S;
5. Find the precursor of a number x in S if exists;
6. Find the successor of a number x in S if exists;

testGenerator.cpp will generate test cases

## Input
The first line of the contains an integer n, indicating the number of operations followed.
In the next lines, each line contains two integers and opt, representing an operation, where
stands for the type of the operation.

## Output
For each type 3, 4, 5, 6 operation, output is a number in one line, representing the answer.
